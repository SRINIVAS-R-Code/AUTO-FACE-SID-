# ✅ CORS Error Fixed!

## Problem
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/data' from origin 'http://localhost:3003' 
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated backend CORS to allow port 3003.

### What I Fixed
**File:** `backend/server.js`

**Changed from:**
```javascript
origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:3002']
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:3001', 'http://localhost:3002', 'http://localhost:3003']
```

Now supports ports: 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003

---

## 🔄 Restart Backend

**IMPORTANT:** You must restart the backend for changes to take effect!

```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm start
```

Wait for:
```
✅ 24/7 Monitoring Service started successfully!
```

---

## ✅ Test

After restarting backend, refresh your browser at:
http://localhost:3003

**The CORS error should be gone!** ✅

---

## 📝 Note

Your frontend is running on port **3003** (not the default 3000).

This is fine! The backend now supports it.

---

**Just restart the backend and you're good to go!** 🚀
