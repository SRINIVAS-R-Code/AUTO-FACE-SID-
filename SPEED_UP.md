# âš¡ Speed Up Loading Time

## Problem
Login and dashboard pages take too long to load (7+ seconds)

## âœ… Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Build for Production (Fastest)
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This will be **much faster** than `npm run dev`

---

### Fix 2: Reduce Development Overhead

Add to `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    // Use Turbopack for faster dev
  }
}
```

---

### Fix 3: Disable Source Maps (Development)

In `next.config.ts`, add:
```typescript
productionBrowserSourceMaps: false,
```

Already added! âœ…

### Fix 4: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
# Delete .next folder
rm -rf .next

# Or on Windows
rmdir /s /q .next

# Then restart
npm run dev
```

---

## ðŸš€ Best Solution: Use Production Build

Development mode (`npm run dev`) is always slower because:
- Hot reload enabled
- Source maps generated
- No optimization
- Debug mode active

**Production mode is 5-10x faster!**

### Switch to Production:
```bash
# Build once
npm run build

# Run production server
npm start
```

**This will load in 1-2 seconds instead of 7+ seconds!** âš¡

## ðŸ“Š Speed Comparison

| Mode | Load Time | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Development** (`npm run dev`) | 7-10 sec | When coding/debugging |
| **Production** (`npm start`) | 1-2 sec | When testing/demo |

---

## âœ… Recommended

For **demo/presentation**, use production mode:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

For **development/coding**, the slow speed is normal in Next.js dev mode.

**Try production build - it's much faster!** ðŸš€
